# bitcoin_OFAC

This is a simple Python program that uses a couple libraries to scrape the SDN List for bitcoin addresses. 
The program is built assuming that the list continues to denominate BTC addresses as "XBT" addresses.
The program could be made better and enhanced to scrape for other coin addresses on the list.

Dependencies for this program are the Pandas, and Requests libraries.
